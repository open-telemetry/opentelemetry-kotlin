# java-typealiases

This module contains typealiases for commonly used symbols from the `opentelemetry-java` project.
This is used internally within `compat` to avoid confusion about whether an
API is defined in the Kotlin or Java SDK, given there is substantial overlap in naming. This could
technically be consumed externally but isn't considered part of the public API
